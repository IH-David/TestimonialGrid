              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned
              were current, if not more so, in the company i joined. I honestly

              "I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been
              looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
              amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and fount
              it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly threreafter. The next 12 weeks 
              was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing
              the course, i've successfully switched careers, working as as Software Engineer
              at a Vr startup."

              "Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line
              of code. I needed some structure from professionals who
              can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged
              to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
              wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
              did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait
              long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular,
              was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level
              in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, i've often
              referred to it during interviews as an example of my development
              experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
              developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "
